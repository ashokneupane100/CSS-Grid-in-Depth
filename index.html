        <p>Here in this page; I want to select background color of everything as green and the text color white. it can be done by universal selector.</p>

        <h2>Type Selector</h2>
        <p>A type selector targets all elements of a specific HTML tag. It's written as the element name itself. I want to make all the h1 type tags as blue background color and bold with white text. </p>

      <h2 class="thirdHeader">Class Selector</h2>
      <p>Here all h2 tags are selected as bg-color to be pink; but I have specified as the class in the css that this one will be the red</p>

      <h3>Next h3 tag </h3>
      <p>This next h3 tag has again become with the pink background.</p>
